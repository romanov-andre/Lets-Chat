# Let's Chat
A GUI based program that allows users to communicate over a data network using the UPD protocol.

This project is divided into two parts:
The Server which is launched and serves as a host where clients can connect to talk to each other.
The Client which attempts to connect to a server by providing a few details.

**Note:** This project was developed with the help of Yan Chernikov (TheChernoProject) trough his Network Programming series and which he teaches the intracacies of creating a program that works with a data network.
